## 🚀 Features

- **Journal Logging**: Add timestamped journal entries, reminders, and thoughts.
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Ask natural language questions like “What was I stressed about in March?”
- **LLM-Controlled Flow**: App behavior (e.g., summarization, categorization) is routed by the LLM itself.
- **Qdrant-Based Storage**: All entries stored in a vector DB for fast, semantic chunk retrieval.
- **Summarization Without Loss**: Every summary respects detail—no critical info is dropped.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Detect long-term mood patterns, recurring ideas, or productivity signals.
- **Reminders & Nudges**: Smart reminder system that nudges you based on behavioral cues.
- **Modular Architecture**: Each part of the RAG pipeline is fully decoupled for ease of development and scaling.
- **Minimal UI**: Lightweight Streamlit or FastAPI interface for demo and interaction.
